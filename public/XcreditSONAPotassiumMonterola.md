## Take on SONA July 2025 of Pres. Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr.
by Hans C. Monterola from 9-Potassium

## 1. 2 key points from the SONA 2025 that I found interesting
   - In the Philippines, brown outs are quite common in a lot of areas. The power being out is normal for a lot of Filipinos. It's fascinating to see the strong focus on renewable energy and making sure people have electricity or power more.
   - During the talk of the education system, the mental health of the youth was mentioned. I find this great as a lot of kids or teenagers' mental health are not talked about that much, and that they may also experience mental health problems already at such a young age.

## 2. 1 key point from SONA 2025 that I found weird
- Political issues or conflicts weren't really talked about or mentioned

## 3. Reflection

Entering the SONA, I am going to be honest, I was anxious. Anxious as for the future of the Philippines and the people. Even though I was terribly anxious, I stil had one of the most powerful things in the world which is hope. I would always try to have faith and hope wherever I was.

When the SONA ended, I left with a lot of hope in me. The programs, goals, and plans sounded really beneficial for the Philippines. However, I was weirded out by some. Overall though, I truly hope and pray that they will be able to deliver and go through with these. Even if these things don't go as planned or not even followed at all, I will never try to lose hope in the Philippines.

## 4. One Phrase for the Philippines
Hope is never truly lost and yes, Hope may die and be forgotten, but there is always another Hope that rises to us.
